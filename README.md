# internal-args-c
This is a library to facilitate operations with arguments in C.
<p>  To use, *<strong>include the library header in your project</strong>*.
  I recommend using the makefile to avoid errors and improve the readability of the directories, <strong>however, if you want, 
  copy and paste the .c code directly into the header</strong>. This is directly down to your preference.
</p>

```c
#include "itrargs.h"
```
